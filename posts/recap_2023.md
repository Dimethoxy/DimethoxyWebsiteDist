## Happy New Year, Music Producers! 🥳

As we ease into 2024, let's take a look at our accomplishments this past year and also take a peek at what we have planned for the year ahead.

### What have we achieved?

Here is a list of the things we got done this year:

1. **🚀 Plasma Release:** Introducing our first creation, Plasma, a powerful Distortion VST plugin designed for aggressive sounds. What's more, it's free and open source!

2. **⚒️ Synthesizer Development:** Embarking on the development journey of our next big project, a cutting-edge kick drum synthesizer to help you create the hardest kicks possible.

3. **🌐 Website published:** Launching our digital home, we proudly presented our website, offering a public space to showcase our software and share our progress on upcoming projects.

4. **📦 New Build Chain:** Enhancing our development efficiency, we seamlessly transitioned our entire C++ build chain from JUCE's Projucer tool to CMake. This strategic move facilitates a more streamlined process for creating and compiling cross-platform binaries. This will hopefully help us expand our platform support to various Linux distros, including Arch and Ubuntu.

5. **🪛 Enhanced Plasma:** Version 1.0.1 addressed significant bugs and enhanced the plugin's visual appeal. In the upcoming 1.0.2 release scheduled for this week, we have significantly improved startup time and overall performance.

### What's in the pipeline?

With the completion of the website, implementation of the new build chain, and resolution of major issues in Plasma, our primary focus will shift towards new projects. \
Our main effort will be dedicated to the development of our Kick Synthesizer Plugin. \
We are also considering the possibility of releasing 1 or 2 smaller mini projects. Stay tuned for more updates!

**🌟 Wishing you all a potentially great and successful 2024! 🌟**
