## Greetings, Sound Wizards! 🎶

We're delighted to unveil the latest iteration of Plasma, introducing our biggest update yet.

## Changes

- **🐧 Pre-built binaries for Linux:** We've listened to your feedback! The most common request we received was support for Linux systems, so we've introduced pre-built binaries for Linux. We are offering LV2 and VST3 versions compiled under Arch Linux. These binaries should seamlessly run on most mainstream distributions.

- **🖱️ DAW native context menus:** Say goodbye to clunky workflows! We've integrated DAW native context menus accessible via right-clicking on any of Plasma's sliders. This enhancement allows for quicker parameter automation in popular DAWs like FL Studio.

- **✒️ Signed, notarized, and stapled MacOS version:** Prioritizing security and compatibility, Plasma's MacOS version is now signed, notarized, and stapled. This ensures a smoother experience without encountering warning messages or quarantine issues.

- **🍏 Support for AU under MacOS:** We've added support for Audio Unit (AU) under MacOS, further improving Plasma's compatibility with your favorite digital audio workstations.

- **📦 Installers for Windows and Mac:** Simplify your setup! Windows and MacOS users can now enjoy dedicated installers, making the setup process faster and more straightforward.

- **🔧 Fixed visibility of filter sliders:** We've addressed a bug where filter slider visibility would reset upon reopening the plugin. This fix ensures a seamless experience, especially in bypass mode.

- **🔍 Fixed wrong font sizes on Linux:** We've resolved font size discrepancies on Linux systems, providing a polished interface and consistent user experience.
