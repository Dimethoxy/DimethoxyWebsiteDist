## Hey there, fellow sonic architects! 🔊

This is our first revision of our distortion VST plugin Plasma. \
The purpose of this update is to bring you a more refined experience.

### Changes

- **🎨New color theme:** The default theme in Plasma now utilizes the Dracula theme color palette. This change ensures improved visibility on devices with lower screen brightness or contrast.

- **🔊Fixed high-pass filter bypass not doing anything:** Previously, setting the highpass filter's slope to bypass did not function as expected. This behavior has now been rectified.

- **👻Re-added missing distortion type:** We have expanded the available options for the distortion type selector, bringing back some of the creative possibilities of the beta version.

- **🪛Improved options button behaviour:** During testing, we observed that many new users would attempt to exit the options menu by clicking the options button again. This proved confusing, as the intended method for closing the options menu was to use the analyzer type slider to switch back to a different analyzer type. Recognizing this as an abysmal user experience, we have now adjusted it so that clicking the options button again after opening the menu returns you to the last analyzer you used."
