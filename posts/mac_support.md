## Hey there, Mac users! 🖥️

We've got some awesome news to share with you all.\
We are thrilled to announce that we are now official members of the Apple Developer Program!

### What Does This Mean for Us?

Joining the Apple Developer Program opens up a myriad of opportunities for us to improve our products.\
Here's a glimpse into what this entails:

- **🚫 No More Unknown Developer Warnings:** Say goodbye to those pesky warnings about unknown developers! Since our plugins are now signed and notarized, they will no longer be quarantined by MacOS.

- **🔒 Code Signing VSTs:** One of the most significant advantages is the ability to code sign our VST plugins. This ensures your safety, guaranteeing that you're always running an official version from us.

- **🌟 Better User Experience:** By adhering to Apple's standards and guidelines, we strive to provide you with a seamless and enjoyable experience.

**🌟 We're thrilled for this new chapter and can't wait to share more exciting updates with you soon. 🌟**
